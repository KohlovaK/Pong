<h1>The Pong Game</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Pong is a two-dimensional sports arcade game that simulates table tennis, featuring simple graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972. The game was created and written by Allan Alcorn.
The player controls a paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is to get more points than the opponent - points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other. <br>
A player on the right side moves their paddle up by pressing "up" arrow and down by pressing "down" arrow. A left player moves their paddle by pressing "w" keyboard to move a paddle up and pressing "s" to move down.
This game uses Turtle graphics. <br>
The game was inspired by: 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023 which is available on Udemy.
